## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Automate cloud infrastructure tasks like creating EC2 instances, S3 buckets, security groups, and monitoring resources.  
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Boto3 (AWS SDK), optionally other cloud SDKs.  
- **Benefits:**  
  - Faster resource provisioning  
  - Repeatable and consistent configurations  
  - Reduced human errors  
  - Easy integration with CI/CD pipelines
